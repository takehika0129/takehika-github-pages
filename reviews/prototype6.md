# **Concept**
This is a simple and lightweight iOS note-taking app designed for users who need a quick and efficient way to create, view, and delete notes without complexity. Built with SwiftUI, the app leverages UserDefaults to store notes locally, ensuring an offline-friendly experience.

# 📖 **How to Use This App**
1️⃣ Creating a Note
- Tap the Title field and enter the name of your note.
- Tap the Content field and type the details of your note.
- Press the “Save” button to store the note.
- Once saved, the note will appear in the Saved Notes section at the top.

2️⃣ Viewing Saved Notes
- All saved notes are displayed in a scrollable list sorted by newest first.
- Notes remain saved even after closing the app.

3️⃣ Deleting the Latest Note
- Tap “Delete Latest” to remove the most recently added note.
- If no notes are left, the screen will display “No notes saved.”

# **Other Features**
- **📝 Multi-line Text Input**: Users can enter long notes using TextEditor, making it easier to structure their content.

# **Challenges & Solutions**  
- **Ensuring Simplicity with Only Two Buttons**: The app needed to be intuitive while keeping the UI minimal. Instead of cluttering the interface with multiple actions, I focused on making "Save" and "Delete Latest" the only two buttons for note management. This approach ensures users can efficiently create and remove notes without unnecessary complexity.

# **Future Improvements**
- **Cloud Sync**: Enable cross-device access so users can retrieve their notes from different Apple devices.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search bar to allow users to filter notes by title or content.
