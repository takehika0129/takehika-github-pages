# **Concept**
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a simple `express` server, making it a great starting point for learning server-side development with Node.js.

  
# **Future Improvements**
- **ðŸ”— Connect to a Database**: Extend the API by integrating MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
- **ðŸ“¡ Deploy Online**: Host the server on Vercel, or Heroku for live API access.
