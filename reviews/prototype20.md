# **Concept**
The goal of this project is to provide an initial approach to exploring, analyzing, and visualizing **Excel** datasets. By leveraging `pandas` for data manipulation and `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for visualization, users can easily uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within their data before diving into deeper statistical analysis or machine learning.


# **Features**
- **ðŸ“Š Data Aggregation & Grouping**: `sum`, `mean`, `median`, `max`, `min`, `std` on different columns.
- **ðŸ“ˆ Useful Visualizations**: Generate histograms, scatter, box, and swarm plots, heatmaps, and grouped charts to analyze distributions, relationships, correlations, and category comparisons.
  

# **Future Improvements**
- **Auto-Generated Reports**: Integrate PDF/Excel exports to generate summary reports with key insights and charts.
- **Outlier Detection**: Implement Z-score analysis or IQR-based filtering to automatically highlight unusual data points.
