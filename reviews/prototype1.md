# **Concept**  
Building a CLI-based todo application in Python is a great way to practice command-line interfaces, argument parsing, and basic data management. 

The basic idea is to let users manage a list via simple subcommands(`add`, `list`, and `remove`).


# **Features**  
- **Subcommand Structure**: Users can run add, list, and remove commands to manage a list.
- **Argument Parsing**: The script leverages Python’s `argparse` module, ensuring the user must provide the right inputs in the correct format.
- **Store in JSON**: Tasks are stored in a JSON file, allowing them to persist between runs.


# **Challenges & Solutions**  
- **Error Handling**: Users might try to remove an item that doesn’t exist. This is addressed by `try/except`, with clear error messages guiding the user to valid indices.
- **Argument Enforcement**: `argparse` automatically ensures the user supplies required arguments, preventing empty or incomplete commands.


# **Future Improvements**
- **Filtering and Searching**: Implement a `find` command to filter tasks by keywords.
- **Advanced Output Formatting**: Show due dates, priorities, or categories for each task.
- **Remote Sync**: Integrate a simple server or cloud storage, so users can access tasks across devices.
