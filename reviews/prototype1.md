**Concept**  
Building a CLI-based todo application in Python is a great way to practice command-line interfaces, argument parsing, and basic data management. 

The basic idea is to let users manage a list via simple subcommands(`add`, `list`, and `remove`).

**Features**  
•	Subcommand Structure: Users can run add, list, and remove commands to manage a list.
•	Argument Parsing: The script leverages Python’s `argparse` module, ensuring the user must provide the right inputs in the correct format.
•	Store in JSON : Tasks are stored in a JSON file, allowing them to persist between runs.

**Challenges & Solutions**  
•	Error Handling: Users might try to remove an item that doesn’t exist. This is addressed by try/except, with clear error messages guiding the user to valid indices.
•	Argument Enforcement: argparse automatically ensures the user supplies required arguments, preventing empty or incomplete commands.
