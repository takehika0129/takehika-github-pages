# **Concept**
This project is to demonstrate how a basic Flask application can quickly be set up to display a friendly greeting in a web browser. It acts as a gentle introduction for those new to Python-based web development.

  
# **Future Improvements**
- **Additional Routes**: At the moment, there’s only one route (/). Expanding the routes would let users explore different sections of your app—like an about page, a contact form.
- **Integration with External APIs**: Tapping into third-party APIs—like weather services, or social media platforms would expand your app’s capabilities.
