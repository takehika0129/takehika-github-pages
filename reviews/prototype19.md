# **Concept**
It creates a beginner-friendly, lightweight web API using `Flask` that can handle GET and POST requests while returning JSON responses.


# **Features**
- **üåç GET /hello**: Returns a simple greeting message.
- **üì§ POST /process**: Accepts JSON data, extracts the "name" field, and returns a customized response.


# **Future Improvements**
- **Expanding API Endpoints**: Implement PUT and DELETE requests to allow users to update and delete records, making the API more interactive.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Add logging mechanisms to track API requests and monitor errors, ensuring better debugging and performance analysis.
