# **Concept**
This project focuses on controlling AWS S3 using AWS CLI directly from a local machine. 

# **Features**
- **🚀 Easy S3 File Management**: Provides simple commands to upload, download, and delete files from S3.
- **🛠️ No Need for Local Credentials**: If using EC2 with IAM roles, authentication is managed without manually setting AWS credentials.

# **Future Improvements**
- **🔄 Automated File Syncing**: Implementing cron jobs or AWS Lambda to automate periodic file synchronization between local storage and S3.
